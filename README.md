# CentralisUHC
A Minecraft Spigot plugin that creates a UHC (Ultra HardCore) game/environment for players at https://c.uhc.gg/#/list to play on.

This codebase was built using the Spigot API (https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/) which is a Minecraft Java framework that is designed for plugin development. This codebase has Maven dependency support and an SQL statistics-based system implemented with holograms.

The whole codebase was play tested through around 60 complete games of UHC. There is even a discord community that I have built in reference to the players that play alongside this codebase. Discord: https://discord.gg/YTEM7Dq

Future features to add:

- Scenarios regarding teams
- More advanced Scenarios (TimeBomb, Moles, etc.)
