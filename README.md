# CentralisUHC
A Minecraft Spigot plugin that creates a UHC (Ultra HardCore) game/environment for players at https://c.uhc.gg/#/list to play on.

This codebase was built using the Spigot API (https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/) which is a Minecraft Java framework that is designed for plugin development.

The whole codebase took roughly 20 hours to produce and was played tested through 5 complete games of UHC. There is even a discord community that I have built in reference to the players that play alongside this codebase. Discord: https://discord.gg/YTEM7Dq

Additional features I plan on adding:

- Teams Mode (Team Management, scattering teams, scenarios regarding teams, etc.)
- Various Scenarios (Blood Diamonds, TimeBomb, Moles, etc.)
- Special Golden Apples (Golden Head drops from player's death, gives special effects to killer)
