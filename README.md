# CentralisUHC
A Minecraft Spigot plugin that creates a UHC (Ultra HardCore) game/environment for players at https://c.uhc.gg/#/list to play on.

This codebase was built using the Spigot API (https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/) which is a Minecraft Java framework that is designed for plugin development. This codebase has Maven dependency support and an SQL + Redis statistics-based system implemented with holograms.

The whole codebase was play tested through around 60 complete games of UHC. There is even a discord community that I have built in reference to the players that play alongside this codebase. Discord: https://discord.gg/YTEM7Dq

If you would like to use this plugin in your server, please download the centralisuhc-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar file from the target folder in this repository and import it into your spigot plugins folder.

Current Scenarios:
- Bowless

- BloodDiamonds
- HasteyBoys
